Bamboo
=======

Bamboo is a continuous integration server that automates the building and testing of your software.
The github Bamboo service can be used to trigger builds after code has been pushed to your git repository.

Install Notes

  1.  Your Bamboo server must be accessible from the internet.

  2.  "base_url" is the URL to your Bamboo server
      Example: https://bamboo.example.com/ or http://bamboo.example.com/bamboo/

  3.  "build_key" is the identifier of the plan you want to trigger
      Example: "BAM-TRUNK", where BAM = project key, TRUNK = plan key

  4.  "username" and "password" - username and password of a Bamboo user that can
      trigger a manual build of the Bamboo plan defined in "build_key"
