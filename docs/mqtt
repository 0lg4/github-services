MQTT
========

This service lets you publish push and commit messages to a message broker via the MQTT protocol.


Install Notes
-------------

  1. Host is the hostname of the MQTT broker.
  2. Port is the port to connect (MQTT default is 1883).
  3. Topic is the name of the topic to publish on (suggested: 'github/<github_username>/<repo_name>').
  4. The payload of the message is JSON received from Github (refer to docs/github_payload).
  5. ruby-mqtt does not support v3.1 of MQTT (username/password), and only supports QoS 0.
  6. For testing, you can use mqtt.io as your web MQTT client: (q.m2m.io:1883, subscribe on topic 'github/<github_username>/<repo_name>').
