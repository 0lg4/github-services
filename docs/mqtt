MQTT
========

This service lets you publish push and commit messages to a message broker via the MQTT protocol.


Install Notes
-------------

  1. 'broker' is the hostname of the MQTT broker.
  2. 'port' is the port to connect (default is 1883, MQTT standard).
  3. 'topic' is the name of the topic to publish on (suggested example: 'github/&lt;github_username&gt;/&lt;repo_name&gt;').
  5. 'id' is the unique client ID which publishes the payload message (default is epoc time).
  4. The payload of the message is JSON received from Github (refer to docs/github_payload).
  5. ruby-mqtt does not support v3.1 of MQTT (username/password), and only supports QoS 0.
  6. For testing, you can use mqtt.io as your web MQTT client: (broker: q.m2m.io, port: 1883, id: &lt;github_username&gt;.  You will "Subscribe to Topics": 'github/&lt;github_username&gt;/&lt;repo_name&gt;').
