Notifo
==========

This service lets your broadcast your commits on Notifo, a mobile notifications platform. Get commit notifications on your iPhone and other mobile devices immediately via PUSH.

Install Notes
-------------

  1. Create a user account on Notifo at https://notifo.com/user/register
  2. Type in your username and the usernames of others wanting to be notified of commits to this repository with Notifo into the subscribers field.
  3. Enjoy.

Notifications are only sent after the service (GitHub) has been approved to send you notifications on Notifo. This happens after the first commit after this service is enabled. You will begin receiving commit notifications from then on.
