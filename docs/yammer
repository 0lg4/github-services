Yammer
======

Install Notes
-------------

1. Create a new Yammer user that will post all of your commit messages by proxy (e.g. git@organization.tld)

2. Login as this user and go to https://www.yammer.com/client_applications/new

3. Create a new application, for example:

	Application name:		organization-git
	Author:				organization
	Author Email:			git@organization.tld
	Main Application URL:		http://organization.tld/
	
4. Save the returned Consumer (Application) Key and Consumer (Application) Secret.  You will need them for the next step.

5. Authorize the application.  You can do this by using the yammer_create_oauth_yml.rb script of the yammer4r gem.

*** Note: on my system (ruby 1.8.7 / OS X 10.6.4) I had to make a (very) small patch to this file to get it 		
	to complete.  It may have been pulled into jstewart's master (http://github.com/jpatterson/yammer4r) by 
	the time you read this -- but if not you can grab mine here at http://github.com/rboyd/yammer4r

	Don't worry, if it fails on the first attempt you can always try again without issue.  ***

6. Enter the output of step 5 (consumer key+secret and access token+secret) into your github service hook form for yammer.
