GitHub Services
===============

There are three main pieces to this service:
1) Sinatra server that handles all of the requests (github-services.rb)
2) JSON payload containing all of the commit data (the same one you get using the API)
3) JSON payload containing the service data (username, password, room, etc)

Steps to contributing:
1) Fork the project
2) Put your code in alphabetical order based on the request path in github-services.rb
3) Vendor any external gems your code relies on, and make sure to include it in the requires at the top of github-services.rb
4) Add documentation to docs/service_name (refer to the others for guidance)
5) Send us a pull request

If you're interested in setting up an interesting test framework to manage the services, that would also be greatly appreciated.
