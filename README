GitHub Services
===============

How the services work:
1) A post-receive background job is submitted when someone pushes their commits to GitHub
2) If the repository the commits belong to has any "Service Hooks" setup, the job makes a request to 'http://services-server/service_name/' with the following data:
  - params[:payload] containing all of the commit data (the same data you get using the API)
  - params[:data] containing the service data (username, password, room, etc)
3) Sinatra (github-services.rb) processes the request (twitters your data, says something in campfire, posts it to lighthouse, etc)
4) Rinse and repeat

Steps to contributing:
1) Fork the project
2) Put your code in alphabetical order based on the request path in github-services.rb
3) Vendor any external gems your code relies on, and make sure to include it in the requires at the top of github-services.rb
4) Add documentation to docs/service_name (refer to the others for guidance)
5) Send us a pull request

If you're interested in setting up an interesting test framework to manage the services, that would also be greatly appreciated.
