GitHub will accept service hooks for the following types of services:

* Production web applications
* Popular internet protocols (Email, IRC, etc).

In order to provide quality service and support for our users, we require the
following:

* Thorough documentation about what the hook does, and what the options do.
* Tested code that works.  If we have to make changes to the Services infrastructure,
it helps a lot to have passing tests so we know we're not breaking things.

We'd also like the following information to help provide quality service and
support to our users:

* A URL for the service (if applicable).
* A URL to a logo for the service (png or gif preferred).
* A maintainer.  Someone that GitHub can contact in the event of bugs.  We prefer
GitHub users, so that we can file issues directly to the github/github-services
Repository.
* A support contact for our users that have problems.  This can be a GitHub user,
an email address, or link to a contact form.
